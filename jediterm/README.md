JediTerm 2.0
------------

This list of features planned for 2.0 version:

* Refactoring of tabs
* Memory consumption optimization - don't store bitmaps in memory, paint from text
* Performance optimization - scrolling of a large text should be fast
* Double-width symbols support - get rid of back-buffer

To achieve these goals a huge rework is necessary. It can break compatibility and can be unstable in the
beginning, so the changes are made in branch.

While master is preserved as stable and will get only bug-fix updates.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JetBrains/jediterm.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JetBrains/jediterm)

The main purpose of the project is to provide a pure Java terminal widget ready
to embed into IDE. From this comes the name
J(from `Java`)edi(reversed `IDE`)Term(obviously from `terminal`)

Branch 2.0 is the actual one - it has entirely rewritten rendering and a lot of fixes.
It will replace the master once become stable.
